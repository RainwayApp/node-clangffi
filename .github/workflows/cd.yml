# This is a basic workflow to generate release artifacts for node projects
# It requires a [Repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
# For `npm publish` that can be obtained [here](https://crates.io/me)
# NPM_TOKEN: <your_token>

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push but only for the main branch
  push:

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
