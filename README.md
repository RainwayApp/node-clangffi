# node-clangffi

Tools to generate Typescript FFI bindings for C/C++ libraries using [libclang](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html) and [ffi-napi](https://github.com/node-ffi-napi/node-ffi-napi).

## Features

- [clangffi](./packages/clangffi) cli tool to generate Typescript bindings.
- [libclang-bindings](./packages/libclang-bindings) library for [libclang](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html) bindings.
- Generates Typescript typings and [ref-napi](https://github.com/node-ffi-napi/ref-napi) types.
- Bring your own `libclang` binary.
- Validated against [llvm-project 13.0.0](./vendor).

See the following packages for more information:

- [clangffi](./packages/clangffi) - cli tool for generating bindings
- [libclang-bindings](./packages/libclang-bindings) - libclang bindings for node

### Coding Guidelines

- This project contains a `.prettierrc` configuration file to help your editor contribute consistent code. For `vscode`, use [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).
- We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to help with automatic semantic versioning. Please ensure your commit messages follow this format.

### Helpful commands

- `npm run bootstrap` to bootstrap the project
- `npx lerna add <dep> packages/<project> [--dev]` to add a dep (`--dev` makes it a dev dep)
- `npm run build` builds all packages
- `npm run clangffi` runs clangffi (remember to build first)
- `npm run generate-dogfood` re-generates our libclang bindings using `libclang-bindings` (ourself).

To get started:

```
# clone and enter the project directory
git clone --config core.autocrlf=false --recursive https://github.com/rainwayapp/node-clangffi.git
cd node-clangffi

# install deps
npm i

# bootstrap and build
npm run bootstrap && npm run build

# bootstrap once last time to ensure typings are present
npm run bootstrap
```
